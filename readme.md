## About

This is my personal website where I write my own thoughts on whatever comes to my mind, whatever I see, whatever makes me emotional on a certain thing. This is, the world in which you can see things from my point of view!

## Development

This project has a submodule (or maybe more in the future), so in order to unnecessary commands, just clone my repository with its submodules from the beginning:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/orzklv/web.git
```

or, if you cloned, but no submodules, let's fetch'em all, shall we?

```shell
cd web
git submodule update --init
```

Afterwards, you need nix to open development environment via flakes:

```shell
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

## Build

I've spent some time to write a flake package which you can use to build my website instantly. All you need to do is:

```shell
# params necessary, blame
# nix submodule problem
nix build ".?submodules=1#" -L
```
