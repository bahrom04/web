## The phone call

It's **April 22nd, 2022**, if I'm not mistaken, it was afternoon. I was doing some open source stuff at home living off of my passive incomes. Out of nowhere, I
got a call from an unknown phone number. Well, I was busy that time, so delayed it and kept doing it until I got some free time and called that number back.
She took the phone and oh men, I still remember her saying: "I'm calling from Uzinfocom, would you like to get a job at our company?". The thing is, I was
running a whole Linux community at the time and I was actively seeking for someone or a company to leave my community to and later move to other country
without worrying, so her offer got me interested. I responded: "Intersting, alright!" afterwards she said: "Can you come to our office at %#&^%$#@#$"
aaaand... yeah... this call was the the beginning of everything.

## It's job interview, isn't it?

Right after that, I got a message telling me to come to office right after that day. The day passed and I was getting prepared for the interview. Asked for
a location on Telegram and drove my good old Nexia 3 to the location. It took me an additional hour to find the place after getting there, cuz I missed the
turn and ended up at the other side of company. Called to her and somehow reached to the destination. I was greated there by [Galina], **the best HR woman
I've ever contacted**. She led me to HR room and introduced the company, after that, she told me that we will be waiting for the CEO of the company to finish the
session. Got my mac and started doing my own thing without even noticing how 5 hours flew away until he crossed the corridor and called us to his room.
I'm gonna be honest that it was for me the first time when I fathomed how CEO himself spoke to people whom they were hiring. Personally, it felt for me as _if
company was trying to be very careful whom they were hiring to the point that even CEO was participating in the process_.

> Before Uzinfocom, the highest position person I spoke to on HR screening was either HR person him/her self or team lead whom they were looking developer for.

The dialogue context reached to salary and I got hired at Uzinfocom and I was like: **"That's it?! Technical interview where?! Why it was so DAMN FAST???"**.

## First day

I've been asked to start working as soon as I bring necessary documents. 3 or 4 days passed by and I came to office after getting introduced to a group of
people at room 223. They all were friendly and greeted me warmly. I even mistook tech lead as the head of department, you know... shit happens, he-he `:D`.
As I didn't have any task to do or something to be busy with, I was just doing code review of my own project, Xinux, at the corner without making a noise.
After some time, tech lead got interested in me and started asking typical programmers questions like:

- What technologies do you know?
- What languages do you use?
- What's your favorite programming language?

Well, after having some conversation about various tech stuff, they didn't seem to me nit picky people as people claim to be, you know, the stereotypes that
government people are bore and unenthusiasts. They were somehow crushing my stereotypical expectations and I was surprised from it.
